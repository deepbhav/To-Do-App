# To-Do-App
Simple Angular application that allows us to add &amp; remove the tasks in it. 

##  Table of contents
Adding an item (learn how to submit a form in Angular )

Removing an item (learn how to add an event in Angular)

Angular animation (learn how animate the components )

##  Prerequisites:
Node.js
Check if node.js is installed in your computer. Learn more about installation.

npm
npm (node package manager) is installed with Node.js

Check the node.js version:

#### node -v
npm:

#### npm -v

## Angular-CLI

You should have the latest version of Angular-CLI. Learn more about Angular CLI here, and find the instructions for installation.

### Install Angular-cli:

#### npm install -g @angular/cli

And finally, you should have:

Basic knowledge of JavaScript
HTML and CSS fundamentals
You don’t need to have any knowledge of Angular.

Now that we have the environment to run our Angular app, let’s get started!

### Creating our first app
We will use angular-cli to create and generate our components. It will generate services, router, components, and directives.

To create a new Angular project with Angular-cli, just run:

#### ng new my-app

The project will be generated automatically. Let’s create our to-do app!

#### ng new todo-app
Then, open the files in your text editor. I use Sublime text, but you can choose any editor.
